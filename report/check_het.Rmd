title: "Check heterozygosity by site"
output: html_document

The only interesting thing here really is that the WinstonSalem heterozygosity is relatively high here.
There does not appear to be any obvious samples with excess heterozygosity for any of the sites, so that is good.
Also note the lack of heterozygotes for the ADPC chip; this is probably because the chip has been enriched for rare variants, 
so in effect heterozygosity cannot really be used to check for sample quality.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sites <- c("chicago",
           #"detroit",
           "jackson_aric",
           "jackson_jhs",
           "jhu_650y",
           "jhu_abr",
           "jhu_bdos",
           "ucsf_pr",
           "ucsf_sf",
           "washington",
           "winston_salem")


plotF <- function(site, dataset) {
  plink.file <- paste0("../data/working/", site, "/", dataset, "_flipped_concordant")
  system(paste("plink --bfile", plink.file, "--het --out het"))
  het <- read.table("het.het", head=T)
  het$H <- 1-het$O.HOM./het$N.NM.
  #hist(het$F, breaks = 20, xlab="F", main=paste(site, dataset))
  boxplot(het$H, main=paste(site, dataset))
}

for (site in sites) {
  par(mfrow=c(1,2))
  plotF(site, "gwas")
  plotF(site, "adpc")
}
