# Rsq thresholds

Suggested by http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22851474: SNPs with MAF <= 0.005 should be removed if they have Rsq <= 0.5; SNPs with MAF > 0.005 should be removed if the have Rsq <= 0.3

## Chromosome 22

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sites <- c("chicago", "jackson_aric", "jackson_jhs")
```
