## Imputation summary statistics

## Folder structure

### data/raw

- <i>10411manifest.xlsx</i>: Rich's manifest file, obtained from Nick
- per site, the fam and bim files received from Nick, which he originally received from the investigators; used to determine which GWAS files to use as input

### data/input

- <i>manifest_master.txt</i>: The first sheet of <i>10411manifest.xlsx</i> (copied and pasted)
- <i>manifest_good_sample_list.txt</i>: List of samples extracted from the first column of the GOOD worksheet of <i>10411manifest.xlsx</i>
- <i>adpc.*</i>: PLINK files for all samples typed on ADPC (originally called <i>ADPC_final</i> and just renamed)
- <i>ADPC_SNPs_flagged_markers.txt</i>: List of SNPs that Nick and Rich identified as failing clustering

### data/input/\<site\>/

Here I had to match the original PLINK files that Nick received from the investigators, to the equivalent GWAS file that he performed QC on. The file names listed below are the original PLINK file prefixes.

- <i>chicago</i>: CAG__2010-09-17__Illumina_1Mv1__hg19 (fam file line count = Nick's previous QC fam file line count;  bim file line count is in the same order as Nick's previous QC bim file)


## Flow diagram nomenclature

- "good" samples are those samples that are listed in <i>manifest_good_sample_list.txt</i>
- n = sample size, m = number of SNPs

## Technical notes

- When the initial ADPC and GWAS files are created, sex and phenotype values in the fam files are set to missing (0)
- The SNP positions of the initial ADPC file was fixed to match dbSNP 142 chromosome end positions (instead of the start position), but not for SNPs with rs IDs - these SNP positions were already correct. This does result in some duplicate SNPs by position (2 SNP pairs), which were removed (4 SNPs).
- Some of the GWAS sites also had duplicate SNPs by position (which might have been introduced when the files were "lifted over"). All of these SNPs were removed (the number is quite low, and it would be hard to tell which SNP of a duplicate pair is really correct, in cases where there are duplicate SNP discrepancies).
- The following PLINK parameters were used for the SNP QC (both GWAS and ADPC): --maf 0.0001 --geno 0.05 --hwe 0.0001
- For SNPs that are discordant between ADPC and GWAS (same SNP in the ADPC and GWAS data sets, for the same sample, with different genotype calls): if a SNP is discordant in 5% of samples or more, the SNP is deleted from the dataset, else the SNP value is set to missing for the sample(s) it is discordant for


## Issues

- For Chicago, there is one additional GOOD common sample, WG0237021-DNAA02, which was not inclduded in the original run. I don't know why...(In the Master sheet of the manifest, all flags are 0 for this sample, it is in the GOOD sheet, it is NOT in the illumina fails sheet, is is NOT in the QC errors sheet.)
